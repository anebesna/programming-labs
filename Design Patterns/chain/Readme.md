Task: using a design pattern, implement an algorithm for determining the banknotes to dispense for a requested amount at an ATM. If it is not possible to dispense the entire desired amount using large denominations (e.g. 200 units of currency), the remaining amount less than 200 units will be dispensed in smaller denominations. If it is not possible to determine the required combination of banknotes, the ATM issues a corresponding message and requests that the user enter a different amount taking into account the available banknotes in the ATM.
